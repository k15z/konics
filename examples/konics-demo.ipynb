    "# Konics Demo\n",
    "The `konics` package primarily consists of the [track api (demo)](/notebooks/track-api.ipynb) and the [drive api (demo)](/notebooks/drive-api.ipynb). The Track API provides an object-oriented interface for designing tracks and rendering them from arbitrary viewpoints while the Drive API create a virtual \"car\" which can drive around on a Track. Check out the demos (see above links) to see how these API's work.\n",

    "I am currently planning a Simulation API which unifies the Track and Drive APIs and provides a reinforcement learning environment with rewards and stuff. It will work something like shown below, but has not been implemented yet:\n",
